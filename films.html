<h1>films</h1>
<p> 
these are the films that i made for high school media studies. i dont think these represent what i am capable of,
i am sadly more proud of my gaming videos. these still show that i did at least try.

SLACKER <br> 
this one i had in my head for about a year. i felt it was too dark and shouldnt see the light of day,
but after asking Jake to make me a song for it, i ended up making it. orignally going to be filmed 
in nyc but my camera person twisted their ankle that day. this was filmed at sims park after me
spending the whole night at universal studios for graduation, and the voice over was done as 
soon as i finished filming, hence the depressing voice.

FATAL FIXATIONS <br>
this one was made in a group. my idea was <a href="lunchbunch.html" style="color:#fc0384;">teenagers in detention film</a>, but i was outvoted opting for 
a dramatic horror. this film shows how much of a writer i am compared to director. i can sit alone in my 
room and write any film i please in a night but actually filming it is the hard part. thank god for Ayanna
and Shalee for getting this one filmed with their friends and sending it to me for editing.
