a film where a regular joe lives in tampa florida and sees pirate themed things and it triggers something in him. 
he eventually sees the pirate ship at raymond james stadium and starts to slowly speak pirate.
with the stadium behind him in the shot, he walks away from the stadium with a full brown pirate buccaneer outfit on.
then he tries to go about his life normally but with everyone thinking of him slightly diffrent.
<br><br>
the psudeo script i wrote later on as the idea changed: <br><br>
yarr, you see, i used to be a pirate, sailing the 6 seas, f*ck (censor with dolphin noises) the antarctic sea that sh*t is so cold. aye sorry, 
i got the mouth of a sailor still, ye see, i’m a normal human now, living among you. it’s a tough life but i make it work, until one day i saw something… <br>
[pirate sees the pirate ship at raymond james stadium, activates him]



<br><br>
this isnt so much as a "gay" metaphor as its a metaphor on how we change by what were infulenced by, and how the world sees us diffrently even though we change every day. <br>
its also very silly
