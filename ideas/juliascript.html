trans girl (Julia)(deadname oliver (ollie)), sad, extremely online, afraid to go outside. <br><br>

int. shot of a trans flag in her room, focus shifts to her face. you can see the light of her monitor scrolling. 
shot then shows what she’s looking at (/lgbt/, egg_irl, twitter, some social platform that shows other people being happy). 
close up of the monitor focusing on things that could make her unhappy. she turns it off and leaves. title. <br><br>

Julia is watching tv, text pops up from carter saying “hey”. she is visibly frustrated and doesn’t respond. another text <br><br>

“i know your upset with me, what i didn’t wasn’t right. i can make it up to you if you just give me another chance” <br><br>

“why would i give you another chance” <br><br>

“because i know right from wrong. introducing you as a man wasn’t right, i won’t do it again.” <br><br>

“then why haven’t you apologized?” <br><br>

“i’m sorry i really regret it” <br><br>

“okay well i accept, please don’t do it again” <br><br>

“i won’t, best friends forever?”<br><br>

“forever and ever” <br><br>

Julia holds the phone close to her heart and smiles.<br><br>

her mother says “ollie, dinners ready!” showing discomfort, gets up and leaves <br><br>

ext. school, very bright out, waiting at the bus loop:<br><br>

carter: “we should hang out after school” <br><br>

julia: “i don’t know, i’ve been a nervous time bomb recently. like i feel like i need something soon because i don’t know what to do anymore.”<br><br>

carter doesn’t pay much attention to what she said, only that she doesn’t want to hang out.<br>
“oh alright, i just wanted us to hang out sometime” <br><br>

julia, feeling bad for carter and not for herself<br>
“alright then maybe, i’ll let you know” <br><br>

“alright sounds good” <br><br>

bully walks buy: “man why you look so gay” <br><br>

other bully: “dawg shutup leave that man alone” <br><br>

Julia seems hurt by this. <br><br>
