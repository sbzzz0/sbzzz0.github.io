write a copy pasta where the mere sight of a boob makes this gay man quiver and vomit. <br><br>

insp. shawn brock <br><br>

“there i was frozen in time, for other people (straights) they only freeze like this when a tragic event happens, 
they slow down time and have a photographic memory, this was worse than that. this was worse than tragic. 
this was worse than death. this was a bare boob in front of me. i couldn’t take it. 
as a gay man you think of these but as soon as you think about it you gag and remove it from your memory. 
but i can’t remove this. i started violently vomiting. i assume my body wanted to cover it with vomit because it 
launched from my mouth and got all over her. i went into the fetal position, hyperventilating, it won’t stop flashing in my head. 
i never knew something like this could exist in this world. something with so much power. a bare breast. i had to be escorted to a hospital. 
<br><br>
NEVER AGAIN”
