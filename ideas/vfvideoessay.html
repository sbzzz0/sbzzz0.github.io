viewfinder is a great game. well actually…<br><br>

open on the 2013 steam grey checkerboard lookin thing<br><br>

hi! this video is about viewfinder but i’d like to give some context beforehand. <br>
i suggest you play viewfinder and these games and form your own opinion. <br>
it is not required for this video, your not going to be lost, 
but i do spoil a lot of these games and they are all best played blind and with an open mind. <br>
there is a specific feeling that is hard to put into words that i and many others associate 
with these games and there’s no other way to experience that apart from first hand. <br><br>

talk about the puzzle genre and how portal defined it. <br><br>

talk about death stranding, it’s well known and the game that the viewer is most likely familiar with <br><br>

then the witness <br><br>

then viewfinder, explaing the opening, then the mechanics, explaining how it’s very creative and satisfying to complete. <br>
but, the game gives you maybe a little bit too much freedom and allows levels to be completed in seconds.
