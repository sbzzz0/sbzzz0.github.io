stand up joke <br><br>

i’m not good at being funny on the spot, i’m not<br>
i can react to something in a funny way, but going from 0 to acts like a clown just isn’t it for me <br>
and it’s sad yaknow because i plan to make it seem like i’m saying this on the spot, like i’m your friend. <br>
but then i reference that i wrote this months ago in a dark room and it just ruins it. <br>
(pause for laughter, if no laughter then say) see?
